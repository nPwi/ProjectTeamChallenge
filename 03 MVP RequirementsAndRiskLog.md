**Story Description & Summary:**
As a player, I would want to have a Sudoku game that I can generate different difficulty levels and have the intelligence solve it on it's own. Upon multiple attempts of solving, I would like to have an option to perform an analysis on the intelligence's ability to solve the levels.

## Risk Log

*In this section list the risks you have identified for your project.  For each Risk identified:*

** Jira Risk URL**
https://ce291teamprojectchallenge.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CE2/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20%22CE2%22%20AND%20type%20%3D%20%22Bug%22%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC

** Risk 1 **
Bug - Difficulty 5 graphic is out of position

** Risk 2 **
Bug - Exit button on Main Menu does not stop application entirely

Both issues both were flagged out as bugs and we had to add them to the following sprint with storypoints to resolve. This put our sprint 4 back by half as we were only able to fulfil new stories that were half our velocity.
We have overcome the issue with Overtime over weekends to clear the bug backlog and catch-up to full velocity on new features.
